# e-library_database
Objectives This project aim to analyze the behaviour of users utilizing e-library applications and also evaluate the management of books in each library, ensuring their utilization can be optimized

Mission Statement
The application is designed to manage multiple libraries, each offering a diverse collection of books that users can borrow. It provides detailed information about each book, including titles, authors, and the quantities available for borrowing. The books are organized into various categories, such as self-improvement, biography, fantasy, romance, and science fiction, making it easy for users to browse and find their interests.
Registered users can interact with the platform to borrow books, place holds, and manage their accounts. Each user is allowed to borrow up to two books at a time from any library in the system, with a borrowing period of two weeks. If a user returns a book before the due date, the system updates the records accordingly. For overdue books, the platform automatically processes the return when the due date is exceeded.
The platform efficiently tracks all loan transactions, including the loan dates, due dates, and actual return dates. It also manages a hold queue for books that are currently unavailable. When a book becomes available, the system notifies the customer at the front of the queue, giving them the opportunity to borrow it. If the customer does not borrow the held book within one week, the system releases the book, making it available for others to borrow.
